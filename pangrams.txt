Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes
Heavy boxes perform quick waltzes and jigs
Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt
The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
How quickly daft jumping zebras vex
